# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_Using_KNN_Classification

# About

A python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits or characters. The project demonstrates the simplicity and effectiveness of the KNN algorithm in classifying images based on their similarities to a set of labeled examples.

## Key Features

1. __KNN Algorithm Implementation__: A straightforward implementation of the KNN algorithm, showcasing its application in image classification tasks.
2. __Handwritten Digit Recognition__: The ability to classify handwritten digits from a standard dataset, such as the MNIST dataset, with a high degree of accuracy.
3. __Elbow Method for Optimal K__: The implementation of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of neighbors (k value) for the KNN algorithm, ensuring the best balance between model complexity and accuracy.
4. __Live Image Prediction__: Users can input live images of handwritten digits or characters, and the model will predict their classifications in real time.
5. __Customizable Parameters__: Users can easily adjust the number of neighbors (k value) and other parameters to experiment with the algorithm's performance.
6. __Data Visualization__: The project includes code for visualizing the handwritten digits, the classification results, and the elbow method plot for selecting the optimal k value.
